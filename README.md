# Programming 3 Exercise project template

1. Make sure you have setup ssh-key for your GitLab account. https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/profile/keys
2. Clone using --recursive
3. Make sure you can build the project. (Should compile without issues if your environment is setup correctly)

## Submodule / CourseLibrary
Submodule for CourseLibrary is currently configured to use ssh. If you haven't yet setup an ssh-key. Go do it at  https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/profile/keys

The page contains also instructions for generating and using existing ssh-keys.

Don't change anything in CourseLibrary ( You won't be able to submit changes made in it )

If you find any bugs and/or missing features you can report them in GitLab  https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/tie-02402-ohj3_2019-2020/courselibrary/issues

## Other notes

You'll probably want to remove MapWindow and make your own, especially if you want a grade better than 1. It's in this template just so you can get started more easily and do some experimenting.

You should create your own code inside your own namespace :)


# You are allowed (and probably should) make changes to this file after you have started your project. :)
